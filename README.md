# <People-Pleaser-Time-Organizer>

## Description

As a people-pleaser myself, I know there are times when I'm committing my presence to several events back-to-back. There are days when breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe even a late-night movie is booked, and it's hard to keep track of what I have to do during which hours of the day. Even without planning to see friends and family, I'm still busy with work, exercising, and school work. It can be a lot to keep up with. However, with this time organizer, anyone with a crazy schedule (whether it's friends, family, work, school, babies, meetings, etc.) can easily see in what time frame they are currently in and what time frames are coming up. The schedule is color-coded so the hour you're currently in is pink, the next hour only is colored green (so you don't feel overwhelmed with every single upcoming events and can focus on tackling them one by one), all other future times are in tan, and past events are in gray.
